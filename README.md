gopro-image-extraction
======================


It's an System-Tray app written in JAVA which downloads movies from the connected gopro and extracts several images per second based on the config.

It uses the gopro wifi API: https://github.com/DomDomHaas/gopro-wifi-API


The API is based on the fireware version 3, I think from gopro 3 being the latest at that time.

Quote from http://goprojavaapi.blogspot.com/ about the API:
"*The APIS below were tested against lastest GOPRO camera with firmware version 3.0.(Current as of July 29, 2013)*"

So it's untested for everything after that.
